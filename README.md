# Cryptography for Geeks

This book started because I found myself bumping into crypthology all the time:

* **Bitcoins**. It felt scary buying bitcoins without having the faintest clue about crypthology. When I learned more about crypthology and how Bitcoin worked I felt confident about what I couldn't trust about it.

* **NSA spying**. What exactly can the NSA find out about us and how can we protect ourselves. How do you safely encrypt files, passwords, email etc.

* **iOS provisioning profiles**. As an iOS developer provisioning profiles were a bit of a black box. I had no clue about how they worked or why they existed in the first place. That made them difficult to work with. At the heart of provisioning profiles is pretty standard cryptology stuff.

* **SSL and HTTPS**. When using your browser you often have to deal with HTTPS. Problems is that when asked about insecure certificates etc I had no clue what was going on. When configuring email I had no idea what the difference between TLS, SSL, WEP etc is.


In short today there are just so many areas affected by cryphtolog that you just ought to have a clue about it.
